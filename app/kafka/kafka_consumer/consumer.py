"""
Kafka Consumer for Discord Commands

This script is a Kafka consumer that continuously listens for messages on a specified Kafka topic.
It is particularly designed to process commands or messages originated from a Discord bot, acting as part of a larger microservice architecture.
The consumer fetches messages from the Kafka queue, processes them, and performs designated actions based on the message content.

Purpose:
- To decouple the message receiving part (Discord bot) from message processing, enhancing scalability and reliability.
- To facilitate asynchronous processing of commands or data received through Discord, using Kafka as a message queue.

How it Works:
- The script initializes a Kafka consumer with specified settings, subscribes to a topic, and listens for new messages.
- Upon receiving a message, the consumer checks for errors, processes valid messages, and logs relevant information.
- It gracefully handles termination signals to ensure that all resources are properly cleaned up before shutdown.

Usage:
- This script is typically run on a server where it can have uninterrupted access to the Kafka cluster.
- It requires configuration settings such as Kafka bootstrap servers, topic name, and consumer group to be set in an `.env` file.
